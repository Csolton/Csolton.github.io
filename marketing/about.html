  <p>
   Hi, Hello, Welcome!
  </p>
<p>
I’m Gaby, your new colorful photographer & videographer! I have been creating photos and videos since the young age of 12, but I FINALLY decided to take things seriously in August of 2021. As a Honduran-American woman, I am huge on inclusivity no matter where you come from! My greatest value is to create art that portrays authentic moments & genuine feelings. I strive to avoid the “say cheese” awkwardness by making you feel comfortable enough to allow your true self to shine! 
  </p>
<p>
I pride myself in being a “do it all” photographer; no shoot idea is too hard, nor impossible! Although, my main strengths are in Lifestyle Photography, Baby 1st Birthdays, Quinceañeras, & Weddings. 
  </p>
<p>
I am a huge collaborator and would love to hear all your photography ideas soon!
