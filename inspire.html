        		I have always found the most inspriation not from historical figures, billionaires, or celebrities, but from the people existing around me at any given moment. It is within the simplicity of the environment around us in which the most extraordinary moments in our lives occur. For this reason, my personal inspiration is drawn from Canadian poet Shane Koyczan.

        		Over the last 100 years no man exemplifies these values for me more than Martin Luther King. He called people to be accountable for the racial prejudices that we all carry. He demonstrated that violence is not the best way to create lasting change. And throughout his life he sacrificed everything to make the world better.
