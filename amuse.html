<h2>Clickhole</h2>
<p>Are you tired of all the boring, or even worse, terrifying news articles that pop into your feed on a daily basis? Clickhole can provide you slideshows of the most random images you could possibly imagine, quizzes to tell you if you're capable to smuggle a king-size kit-kat into a movie theatre, and more! The articles are nearly endless and enough to keep you entertained for hours.<br>

<h2>Zoom Quilt</h2>
<p>If you need a good 5 minutes to shut your brain off, this is the site for you. This website zooms in on a picture neverendingly and there is always something more to see. The artwork combined with the endless hole of zooming will leave you hynotized and substantially "zoned".<br>
